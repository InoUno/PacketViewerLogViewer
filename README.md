# PVLV

This program is meant to be used with .log files made with the Windower4 Packetviewer add-on.
It is also able to read Ashita Packeteer .txt log files.

The program should be pretty straight forward to use for anybody for who it would be usefull.

The end idea is to make a program that can mimic the track function for the original addon, but in a offline fashion by parsing the log files

Currently working on a C# version of the viewer in .NET using Visual Studio 2017
Doesn't really do anything as for now

For a functional program, please check my Delphi Project instead
